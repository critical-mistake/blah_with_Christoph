# Learning to programe (a bit)

* language has/wants: python, C++, R
* likes doing: solve math problems
* suggestion:
  * first quick overview of all paradigms (imperative {procedural/object-oriented} and declarative {functional/logic-oriented})
  * a language for each of those paradigms
* at the end more deep dive into python and C++
  * solve single problems and wrap up with implementing a useful project)

## Session 1

* setup github
* do some "pair programming" (switching every 5mins)
* write a C CLI tools (use make)
  * read input from file
  * calculate (quicksort, binary search)
  * ... later: same algorithms with haskell
